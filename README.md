This app displays facilities enrolled under the Stormwater Industrial General Permit that have had discharges exceeding the permit's numeric action levels (NALs). Facilities that have violated NALs for a pollutant are elevated to "Level 1", and have to develop a Exceedance Response Action Level 1 Report. Facilities that continue to exceed NALs for a pollutant get elevated to "Level 2" and must complete an Exceedance Response Action Level 2 Action Plan.

This app utilizes the flexdashboard package. Users select a constituent from a drop down menu and the app displays a map and table of Level 1 and Level 2 facilities for that constituent. A treemap on the bottom-right shows the relative proportions of Level 1 and 2 facilities for each constituent.
